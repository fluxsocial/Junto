# Junto Rust Application
This application is still in its very early stages and is likely to change dramatically as holochain develops further along with development abilities/understanding at Junto.

## Calling the API

To run our holochain application with a http interface inside `junto-rust` run the following command: `hc run --interface http`. That will run a developer conductor of our holochain application at port `8888`.

To find out how to make the appropriate HTTP requests to our application please view: https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/conductor_json_rpc_api.html
